# Global-AI-HUB---AYGAZ-Bootcamp-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence
This repo was created according to the requirements of the Aygaz Bootcamp program organized by Global AI HUB. 
The main purpose is to meet the project requirements and explain the steps taken. The basic requirements in 
the project are as follows;

1. Dataset Selection
• Participants can use the Fashion Mnist, cifar10 datasets available in the Keras library as a dataset or any image dataset they want.

2. Data Preprocessing
• Divide the data into X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test.

• Print the dimensions of the data divided into X_train, X_test, y_train and y_test.

• Print the dimensions of the images in the dataset.

• Visualize the images in the dataset (Ex: Visualize 10 images).

• Normalize the data (Normalize).

3. Create and Train the Model
• Train the model using machine learning algorithms (Knn, Svm, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBM, LightGBM, XGBoost, Catboost etc.) or Deep Learning algorithms (optional) and evaluate the results. (Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks etc.)

• Note: You can use any metric as evaluation metrics, but it would be healthier to use more than one metric in order to evaluate your model.
(Accuracy, Recall, F1- score, Precision, Auc, Roc )
